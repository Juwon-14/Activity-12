Activity 12 - It is a program in which a user inputs a positive number and calculates and outputs a factorial of the number.
else {
    for (int i = 1; i <= number; ++i) {
        factorial *= i;
    }
Factorial calculation: If the entered number is not negative, it calculates the inheritance of the number. Inheritance is the result of multiplying all integers from 1 to the input value.
